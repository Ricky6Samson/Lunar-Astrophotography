 **Lunar Astrophotography Project**
 *Observational Astronomy Certificate – St. Joseph’s University, Bengaluru*  
 *Under the guidance of **Dr. Ajay Saxena**, Former Dean – Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru*

---

🔭 **About the Project**  
Captured, processed, and analyzed high-resolution images of the Moon using a **12-inch Ritchey–Chrétien Cassegrain Telescope** and smartphone sensors. This project focused on both **observational astronomy & computational image processing** to study lunar craters, maria, rilles, and impact basins.

 **Equipment & Capture Setup**
• 12-inch RC Cassegrain Telescope  
• Smartphone cameras (Realme X7 Max, Samsung Galaxy M32) using telescope mount  
• Moon filter + 44 mm eyepiece  
• Remote shutter trigger for vibration-free imaging  
• **Location:** St. Joseph’s University Observatory, Bengaluru (~900m altitude)

 *Observation Period:* 23–27 March 2024  
 *Phases Captured:* Waxing Gibbous → Full Moon → Waning Gibbous  
 *Camera Settings:* ISO 100 | 1/400s | f/11
